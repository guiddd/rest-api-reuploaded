# CRUD rest users api

## Description

In this small practice project, I created a CRUD rest api of users and it's corresponding [app](https://github.com/guidocq/users-app-consume-api) to manage it

The api functions inside **node** as environment, uses **express** to handle the router and backend and **sequelize** to communicate with a sql database
